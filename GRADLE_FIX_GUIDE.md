## 🔧 **COMPREHENSIVE FIX (If Quick Fix Fails)**

```powershell
.\fix_gradle_issue.ps1
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Update Flutter to latest stable
2. ✅ Fix Gradle version compatibility
3. ✅ Clean all caches thoroughly

## 🔍 **Manual Fix Steps**

If scripts don't work, follow these manual steps:

### 1. **Update Flutter**
```bash
flutter upgrade
flutter doctor
```

### 2. **Clean Everything**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub cache clean
rm -rf build .dart_tool android/.gradle android/app/.cxx
```

### 3. **Fix Gradle Wrapper** (`android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`)
```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-all.zip
```

### 4. **Fix Android Gradle Plugin** (`android/build.gradle`)
```gradle
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.1.4'

}
```

### 5. **Rebuild**
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

## 📊 **Version Compatibility Matrix**

| Flutter | Gradle | Android Gradle Plugin | Kotlin | Status |
|---------|--------|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| 3.24.x | 8.5 | 8.1.4 | 1.9.10 | ✅ **WORKING** |
| 3.24.x | 8.6 | 8.4.1 | 1.9.24 | ❌ **BROKEN** |
| 3.22.x | 8.4 | 8.0.2 | 1.8.22 | ✅ Working |

---

## 🚨 **If Still Failing**

### **Check Flutter Doctor**
```bash
flutter doctor -v
```

### **Accept Android Licenses**
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

### **Recreate Android Configuration**
```bash
flutter create --platforms android . --overwrite
```

### **Check Java Version**
```bash
java -version
# Should be Java 11 or 17
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

The `validatePlugins` and `enableStricterValidation` methods were introduced in newer Gradle versions but your Flutter installation was trying to use them with an incompatible setup.

**The fix**: Use proven compatible versions that work together.

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

After running the fix, you should see:
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in Xs
✅ APK created at: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

**File size**: ~20-50 MB for debug APK

## 🔄 **Prevention**

To avoid this in the future:
1. Always use the build scripts (they include compatibility checks)
2. Don't manually update Gradle versions without checking compatibility
3. Keep Flutter updated but test builds after updates
4. Use `flutter doctor` regularly to check for issues
